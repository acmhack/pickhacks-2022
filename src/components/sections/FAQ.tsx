            Due to shipping delays from COVID, you can expect to receive 
            your swag sometime around late April. However, we don't want 
            to keep you in suspense! You can expect to recieve a sweatshirt, 
            stickers, and more awesome goodies! We will not be shipping swag 
            to hackers outside of the US and Canada.
